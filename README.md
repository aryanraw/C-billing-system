## Code Breakdown üß©

### Variables
- `int code` - Stores the pizza code entered by the user.
- `int qty` - Stores the quantity of pizza ordered.
- `float price` - Stores the price of the selected pizza.
- `float amt` - Stores the amount for the current order.
- `float totalAmt` - Stores the running total amount for all orders.
- `float cash` - Stores the cash tendered by the user.
- `char addAnother` - Stores the user's choice to add another order.

### Main Loop
The program uses a `do-while` loop to:
- Clear the screen and display the menu.
- Accept user input for pizza code and quantity.
- Calculate and display the amount for the current order and update the total amount.
- Ask the user if they want to add another order.
- Repeat until the user decides to stop adding orders.

### Cash Handling
A `do-while` loop ensures that the cash tendered is enough to cover the total amount. It then calculates and displays the change.
